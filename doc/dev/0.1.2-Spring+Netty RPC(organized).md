# Spring + Netty RPC (Version 0.1.2)

## Overview

Version `0.1.2` brings further organization and modularization to the Spring + Netty RPC framework. This version focuses on improving the project structure while retaining the core functionality from the previous release (`0.1.1`). The client, server, and common components have been split into separate modules to promote better maintainability and scalability.

## Key Features

- **Modularization**: The project is now split into three distinct modules: `rpc-client`, `rpc-server`, and `rpc-common`.
- **Spring and Netty Integration**: Maintains seamless integration of Spring for dependency injection and Netty for network communication.
- **RPC Proxy**: Utilizes dynamic proxies to allow clients to invoke methods on remote services as if they were local.
- **Log4j Logging**: Continued use of Log4j2 for clear and efficient logging throughout both client and server operations.
- **Spring Bean Management**: Services are registered and managed within the Spring container, making it easier to configure and extend.

## Project Structure

### 1. **Modules**

- **`rpc-client`**: Contains all client-side logic, including the RPC client and dynamic proxy implementation (`NettyRpcClient`, `RemoteInvokeProxy`).
- **`rpc-server`**: Handles server-side logic, such as managing Netty-based communication (`NettyRpcServer`, `NettyServerInitializer`) and service registration (`ServiceProvider`).
- **`rpc-common`**: Shared code between client and server, such as request/response models (`RpcRequest`, `RpcResponse`) and service interfaces (`UserService`).

### 2. **Key Classes**

- **`NettyRpcClient`**: Manages sending RPC requests to the server and receiving responses.
- **`NettyRpcServer`**: Initializes the server and processes incoming requests from clients.
- **`RemoteInvokeProxy`**: Intercepts client method calls and forwards them to the remote server.
- **`RpcRequest` & `RpcResponse`**: Define the structure of RPC communication between client and server.

## Improvements Over Version 0.1.1

- **Module Separation**: Client and server logic are now cleanly separated, allowing for independent development, testing, and deployment.
- **Enhanced Code Organization**: Common components are isolated in the `rpc-common` module, which improves reusability and clarity.

## Running the Project

1. **Server**: Start the server by initializing the Spring container, which will automatically launch the Netty server.
2. **Client**: Invoke services via the `UserController` by sending requests through the dynamically created RPC proxy.
